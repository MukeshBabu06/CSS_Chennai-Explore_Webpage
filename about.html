        <p class="about">
            Chennai formerly known as Madras, is the capital city of Tamil Nadu, the southernmost state of India. It is
            the state's primate city and is located on the Coromandel Coast of the Bay of Bengal. According to the 2011
            Indian census, Chennai is the sixth-most populous city in India and forms the fourth-most populous urban
            agglomeration. Incorporated in 1688, the Greater Chennai Corporation is the oldest municipal corporation of
            India and the second oldest in the world after London. <br> <br>

            Historically, the region was part of the Chola, Pandya, Pallava and Vijayanagara kingdoms during various
            eras. The coastal land which then contained the fishing village Madrasapattinam, was purchased by the
            British East India Company from the Nayak ruler Chennapa Nayaka in the 17th century. The British garrison
            established the Madras city and port, and built Fort St. George, the first British fortress in India. The
            city was made the winter capital of the Madras Presidency, a colonial province of the British Raj in the
            Indian subcontinent. After India gained its independence in 1947, Madras continued as the capital city of
            the Madras State and present-day Tamil Nadu. The city was officially renamed as Chennai in 1996. <br> <br>

            The city is coterminous with Chennai district, which together with the adjoining suburbs constitutes the
            Chennai Metropolitan Area,[c] the 35th-largest urban area in the world by population and one of the largest
            metropolitan economies of India. Chennai has the fifth-largest urban economy, and had the third-largest
            expatriate population in India. As a gateway to South India, Chennai is among the most-visited Indian cities
            ranking 36th among the most-visited cities in the world in 2019. Ranked as a beta-level city in the Global
            Cities Index, Chennai regularly features among the best cities to live in India and is amongst the safest
            cities in India. <br> <br>

            Chennai is a major centre for medical tourism and is termed "India's health capital". Chennai houses a major
            portion of India's automobile industry and hence the name "Detroit of India". It was the only South Asian
            city to be ranked among National Geographic's "Top 10 food cities" in 2015 and ranked ninth on Lonely
            Planet's best cosmopolitan cities of the world. In October 2017, Chennai was added to the UNESCO Creative
            Cities Network (UCCN) list. It is a major film production centre and home to the Tamil-language film
            industry.
